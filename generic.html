										<p>Cleo Nagbe, the mother of the victim of a 16-year-old boy, Ralph Yarl, speaks out against an attempted murder suspect in Kansas City, Missouri. </p>
									
										<p>The mother says that the young boy has been affected mentally by last week’s attack. Ralph Yarl who rang the doorbell of the wrong house and was just trying to pick up his siblings, was shot in the head through the glass door by a white man and shot him again as the kid bled out. </p>
										
										<p>"You can see that he is just replaying the situation over and over again. And that just doesn't stop my tears either, because when you see your kid just sits there and constantly, he just— tears are just rolling from both sides of his eyes, there's nothing you can say to him," Nagbe told <a href=" https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ralph-yarl-kansas-city-black-teen-shot-wrong-house-mother-injuries/ "> CBS News</a> on Tuesday, April 19, 2023.</p>
										
										<p>Nagbe says that the boy is surrounded by medical professionals who stabilize his overall well-being, while she is also hands-on as she is a nurse herself.</p>
										
										<p>Ralph, as reported by <a href=" https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article274400460.html">Kansas City Star</a> has been released from the hospital and is recovering at home with the support of his family. His father, Paul Yarl says, “He continues to improve. He’s responsive and making good progress.” </p>
										
										<p>Meanwhile, the 84-year-old, Andrew D. Lester, faces charges of first-degree assault and armed criminal action, according to Kansas City Star. If found guilty the suspect will face 10 to 30 years or life imprisonment and a $200,000 bond.</p>

										<p>The suspect was initially released and it sparked outrage among many citizens. The reason for this was that the prosecutors required an official statement from the victim and forensic evidence to finalize the case file before they could charge the suspect.</p>

										<p>The shooting angered people across the country, even the globe. Many call it another racist violence. Protesters and even celebrities joined forces to make noise across the country to end the violence against black children, emphasizing the #BlackLivesMatter</p>
										
										<p> <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/rep-cleaver-says-ralph-yarl-171638318.html">Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver</a> said, “I can think of no justification for shooting a child multiple times for ringing the wrong doorbell—and we as a society ought to think very carefully about whether or not that is the world we want to live in.” </p>

										<p>Yarl’s aunt, Faith Spoonmore, wrote on a GoFundMe page that the teenager was doing physically well but is suffering emotionally and mentally because of the attack that would require further treatment.</p>

										<p>Ralph stayed in the hospital for three nights and his family has <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/nf36y-cover-medical-expenses">created a GoFundMe to raise money for medical bills.</a></p>
