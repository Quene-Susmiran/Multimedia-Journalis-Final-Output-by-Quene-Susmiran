										<p>In these times of economic uncertainty, a Filipino bride from Bingawan, Iloilo has found a unique way to cut costs without sacrificing style on her wedding day. The bride’s bold choice has been turning heads and sparking conversations, with some praising her wittiness and creativity and others simply admiring her confidence. Instead of carrying a traditional bouquet, she chose to walk down the aisle with fresh onions. </p>
									
										<p>“Yung unang plan kasi namin is stick kami sa original tradition na flowers for entourage. Then, when I was browsing the socmed, my nakita akong bouquet na made from onions with a touch of flowers," the bride, April Lyka Biorrey, told <a href="https://www.facebook.com/IloiloMetroTimes/photos/pcb.5888943997887552/5888942654554353?paipv=0&eav=AfbrmWleJ1-EqDspS35RKPPZXzM7b4q1SsMupsEzzmerBFraA3Uq8ejLq-jlyiwZk7w&_rdr ">Iloilo Metropolitan Times (IMT) News.</a>  </p>
										
										<p>The decision to use the onions was inspired by the skyrocketing prices of the flowers in the market.  "I consulted my groom (Erwin Nobis) na kung pwede namin yun nalang ang gamitin kasi if flowers, after the wedding pangdisplay nalang at kung malanta itapon nalang din. So why not magsibuyas nalang? Praktikal pa in a way na magagamit din naman after the wedding," she added</p>
										
										<p>The bride told the <a href="https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1193453 ">Philippine News Agency (PNA)</a> that onion bouquets are more practical since they can be used after the wedding for daily consumption while flowers will only last a few days and will be discarded when they withered. Her wedding coordinator also told PNA that they ordered one sack of onions from La Union since there is none available in Iloilo. The bride shared that the sack only cost them PHP8,000 while initially, they planned to spend PHP15,000 for the flowers.</p>
										
										<p>“After the wedding, the onions were given to our godparents and bridesmaid so they have with them onions for souvenirs. I also gave my bouquet to our relatives for their everyday use,” she added.</p>
										
										<p>According to <a href="https://coconuts.co/manila/news/cartels-could-be-behind-crazy-onion-prices-in-the-philippines-lawmaker-warns/ ">Coconuts Manila</a> , the cost of onions has risen to a staggering 457% above the global average, making it difficult for market vendors to sell them at a reasonable price. A lawmaker suspects that price manipulation by certain individuals or groups may be contributing to the problem.</p>

										<p>However, they prices are expected to go down according to <a href="https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1193803 ">PNA as stated by the Department of Agriculture</a> . “Ang pinakamababa po na presyo ay umabot sa mga PHP67 or a little less than PHP70 per kilo. So, ’yun po ang tinitingnan natin ngayon kung paano natin maibabalik ang ganung presyo. Although ito po ay presyo sa panahon na talagang peak of their harvest (The lowest price was as low as PHP67/kg or less than PHP70/kg. So, that's what we're looking into, how to bring back that level of price. Although this price was during the peak of harvest),” DA Assistant Secretary Kristine Evangelista said. </p>

										<p>Despite all the negativities of the skyrocketing prices of onions, the bride chose practicality, as she believes that her guests would appreciate something they can use for daily consumption. Having onions as part of her giveaways can ease financial burdens in the kitchen. </p>
										
										<p>In the end, the bride’s choice of an onion bouquet not only saved her money but also added a unique and memorable touch to her special day.</p>
